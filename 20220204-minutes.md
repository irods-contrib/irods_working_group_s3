## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - Updates
   - Uni-bucket projection is being used
     - Ticket login is working
     - Need to learn how to query the fullpath available for this ticket
       - TICKET_COLL_NAME will give fullpath
       - TICKET_OBJECT_TYPE will give read/write
         - Can possibly map this to the bucket policy
         - Affect the MinIO interface (no edit/upload buttons)
     - Got it working during the meeting (see below)
   - MinIO can't be launched as multi-tenant
     - The gateway code fires 'too late' to be able to see the password
     - The auth code is in MinIO core...
     - So currently limited to single MinIO instance per ticket
       - Will continue to investigate core code, possible extension/upstream
         - Possibly tell MinIO to do 'no check' on auth
           - Put MinIO in 'iRODS' mode...
           - via environment variable?
         - Just pass the user("ticket") and pass(ticket_string) to the gateway code

----

Works / tested on the call
 
As anonymous `iquest` as example...
 
```
$ iquest "select TICKET_ID, TICKET_TYPE, TICKET_COLL_NAME where TICKET_STRING = 'ticket_test_no'"
TICKET_ID = 805975639
TICKET_TYPE = write
TICKET_COLL_NAME = /iplant/home/iychoi/ticket_test
```

And then in Go...
 
```
query := message.NewIRODSMessageQuery(common.MaxQueryRows, 0, 0, 0)
	query.AddSelect(common.ICAT_COLUMN_TICKET_ID, 1)
	query.AddSelect(common.ICAT_COLUMN_TICKET_TYPE, 1)
	query.AddSelect(common.ICAT_COLUMN_TICKET_COLL_NAME, 1)
 
	condVal := fmt.Sprintf("= '%s'", ticket)
	query.AddCondition(common.ICAT_COLUMN_TICKET_STRING, condVal)
```
