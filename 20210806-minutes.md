S3 Interface for iRODS

Discuss authentication for ...

> [Option 3)](./20210731-email.md) Add irods/gateway-irods' to upstream https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/cmd/gateway
>
> Someone / all of us would port / implement the same work from Option 2 (convert to pure Go), but work with the minio community to get iRODS to be an officially supported gateway for the MinIO server directly.

Is this a working group?   Surprise?!


GoRODS implementation of tickets
- https://github.com/jjacquay712/GoRODS/blob/8cf431c0fda7e020a5d61e33389d16f21bc80333/HOWTO.md#irods-tickets
- https://github.com/jjacquay712/GoRODS/blob/8cf431c0fda7e020a5d61e33389d16f21bc80333/connection.go#L603


CyVerse internal discussion
 - multiuser environment... is it minio per person, per project, how does it work?
 
rodsadmin requirement in GoRODS was.. as far as we remember.. only for the SpecificQuery functionality

`r_data_main.data_name` is only 1000 characters... s3 path can be 1024...
 - so we're close, but can't quite get to the spec
 - so GoRODS used Metadata (2700chars)

interesting to have 'throwaway' accounts/access

cyverse would have a nightmare quickly to use 'real' irods credentials

perhaps there's a service to create/manage tickets
 - and those are used as access/secret, or zone/access, or ticket/secret
 
access == 'ticket' or some other string

Proposal:
 - ENV variable set to 'ticket mode'...
 - then any secret would be interpreted as the ticketID
 - becomes a simple passthrough to iRODS
 
 
NewGateway

```
  docker run -p 9000:9000 \
    -e "MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=BKIKJAA5BMMU2RHO6IBB" \
    -e "MINIO_SECRET_KEY=V7f1CwQqAcwo80UEIJEjc5gVQUSSx5ohQ9GSrr12" \
    minio-irods-gateway gateway irods \
    192.168.1.147 1247 tempZone /tempZone/home/colName

ACCESS_ID = ticket:/tempZone/mountpoint
SECRET = {ticket-val}
```

if we do not provide the 'mount path' to the gateway...
 - then the ticket access could determine the path information
or

if the collection-based ticket provides read or read/write access...
 - we're good

open question - does access with a ticket find out what it can access?

Live brainstorming...

sidecar 'fancy service' to share things...
- takes a request to generate a MinIO token
  - collection path
  - produces a GUID and iRODS ticket
  - puts the GUID as AVU on the collection
- takes GUID
  - issues genQuery to iRODS
  - resolves and returns the collection path
- has a shared secret/token to be able to make GenQuery calls in iRODS
- this becomes a generic service to provide S3 access tokens for iRODS
  - regardless of MinIO... also works for cyberduck, etc.

- MinIO uses GUID/access and ticket/secret
  - /// and gateway genQuery finds the collection with that AVU
  - navigates to that collection path
  - only an issue because this is a web gui
  - isn't an issue for 'mc', minio command line tool, or any other S3 API client


Is there a way for MinIO to do different auth to the storage backend?
 - I (tgr) think the answer's no...
 - Illyoung says... yes?  can't find an example so far

Use case
- iRODS users want to share and access via s3
- docker container is running with tony's id/password
- users connect to s3... and see... what?



Next steps...
- write out a user story for 2-3 scenarios
- separate the design a bit more
- Illyoung to investigate read/write scenarios
  - to look at the Python client for multi-1247
  - replica access token - technique for coordinated writes to same logical path
  - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_nfsrods/issues/124#issuecomment-866815643  
- Terrell will begin machinery to continue this as an iRODS Working Group
- Illyoung will investigate adding ticket access to go-irodsclient
