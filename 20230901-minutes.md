## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - Native C++ S3 Implementation
   - Justin James is now the primary developer for this project
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_s3_cpp/pull/18
     - HMAC / Signatures were not the problem
       - Turned out we were encoding them multiple times
     - ListObjects now works with aws client
   - Improved build and packaging
     - CMake is closer in structure with other iRODS projects
     - Uses new Boost 1.81.0 externals package instead of compiling from source
   - Testing
     - Seen various forms of success across clients: boto, mc, aws
       - Issues are related to setting proper HTTP response headers
     - TODO: Add scripts for each client which show working/runnable examples
   - Illyoung: Is there a release date for this?
     - Kory: Not yet, but once iRODS 4.3.1 is released, we'll be in a better position to provide an experimental build that people can use
   - Alan: What do people expect to be normal and boring for external dependencies?
     - Git submodules vs package repositories
     - Tony: submodules don't seem so bad, but used to the Consortium shipping externals packages
     - Illyoung: As long as compilation is simple/clear/consistent, the approach isn't a problem. Perhaps a docker environment for compilation
