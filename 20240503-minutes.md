## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - iRODS 4.3.2 (and S3 plugin) released
   - CMake updates
   - Bugfixes and server response cleanup
 - iRODS S3 API
   - Multipart was merged
   - 0.2.0 was released
   - Tony's speed tests added to March minutes
     - v0.1.0 - 1404 seconds for 1G upload
     - v0.2.0 - 180 seconds for 1G upload
     - Still not the 13s from iCommands
     - Still doing store-and-forward, opportunity for good ideas here
 - Tony use case
   - S3 bucket with lots of files
   - Wants to run CyVerse analysis on it
   - Can we mount a bucket as s3 resource
   - This is related to BYOB (bring your own bucket)
   - Can we set the root / mount path for s3 plugin into the irods namespace
     - New context string option...
       - S3_TRUNCATE_PHYSICAL_PATH_INITIAL_ELEMENTS=2
       - S3_TRUNCATE_ROOT_PHYSICAL_PATH_ELEMENTS=3
       - S3_TRUNCATE_PHYSICAL_PATH_STRING='/zonename/home/user'
       - S3_TRUNCATE_VAULT_PATH_STRING='/zonename/home/user'
       - S3_TRUNCATE_VAULT_PATH_ELEMENTS=3
       - S3_CHOP_INITIAL_VAULT_PATH_ELEMENTS=3
       - S3_LTRIM_VAULT_PATH='/zonename/home/user'
       - S3_LTRIM_LOGICAL_PATH='/zonename/home/user'
       - S3_TRUNCATE_INITIAL_PATH_STRING='/zonename/home/user'
       - S3_CHROOT='/zonename/home/user'
       - S3_SPLITROOT='/zonename/home/user'
       - ROOT_COLL - CHROOT from the zone to something deeper
       - MOUNT_COLL - same as ROOT_COLL - synonym
       - And what's the default?  Just get the fullpath, like always.
       - Doesn't want `/zonename/home/username/remotes3'
       - A third ARCHIVE_NAMING_POLICY
         - in addition to decoupled/consistent...
         - calling this one 'chroot', like consistent, but trimmed/shortened/reduced
         - and if in this mode, the plugin honors this new context string option
     - Concern: user can now touch 'out-of-band' from irods protocol
       - Going to have drift
       - Have to use iscan / ifsck, etc.
       - Registration tool
     - But only for a single user?
     - Personal resource (resource per person) -> s3 bucket
       - and cyverse stores the keypair and is trusted by the user(!)
   - Decoupled mode wouldn't help - would be gibberish to the human later
   - `iadmin modrescdatapaths`
     - modrescdatapaths Name oldpath newpath [user] (update data-object paths, sometimes needed after modresc path)
   - A rule would have to be written that protects that resource to only be written by a certain user
     - otherwise, other users could write into a different user's bucket
     - Resource level operations would be where the PEP would be most effective (open/read/write)
       - RESOURCE_OP_REGISTERED is called when something is created
 - Next meeting
   - June 2024
