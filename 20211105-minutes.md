## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - RENCI Update
   - Designed and built a python flask app, but it would require admin account
     - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_s3_ticketbooth
   - Then learned anonymous could GenQuery for which logical collection (not a data object) is associated with an existing ticket
   - So...
     - REST C++ API 0.9.0 will have full ticket support
     - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_rest_cpp
   - Need to confirm "anonymous:" with empty password creates correct auth header - REST C++ needs to learn about 'anonymous' special user
   - Hope this means that Minio can just catch this ticket value and use as "ticket:kjsdfkjsdfkjdfkjaskjas" in the minio login form.
 - CyVerse Update
   - Tested parallel upload with 4.2.10 in container - success
   - Will start testing minio integration
   - Go-irodsclient on windows also worked well
     - Interested in packaging for windows/mac/linux
   - Gateway will use 'anonymous' to query for associated target collection
     - iquest "select TICKET_COLL_NAME where TICKET_ID = 'xxxxxx'"
   - Then use ticket access to drop user into that collection in minio GUI
 - Next Meeting - Friday, Dec 3

WORKING NOTES - DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO MEETING

Mental Model - App wants to put data into S3
  * App gets s3 credentials from Amazon or someone else...
  * App talks to s3 via s3 protocol
  * Data is now in s3


Actual Model - App wants to put data in iRODS (but still thinks it's s3)
  * App goes to ticketbooth (gets s3 credentials, actually just "ticket"/idfhiuer398343984tiuh
  * App talks to minIO via s3 protocol (with "ticket"/idfhiuer398343984tiuh)
  * Data is now in iRODS


So maybe our code is only an overlay over the existing REST API?


Candidate REST endpoints...
  * Create (new ticket)
     * Authentication - iRODS credentials
     * Requires
        * Collection fullpath
     * Actions
        * Generates a ticket (GUID)
        * puts the GUID as AVU on the collection
     * Returns
        * GUID
  * Resolve (ticket to collection) (for MinIO / other GUIs)
     * Authentication - not sure… none?  Admin?
        * If none… can none run a genquery?
        * Can a ticket provide genquery permission?  Instead of read/write?
           * No
        * Solution… ticketbooth deploy requires an admin account
           * Would *only* be used here, to do this lookup/resolve
           * Because minIO isn't iRODS authenticated itself...
     * Requires
        * GUID
     * Actions
        * GenQuery to lookup collection via GUID
     * Returns
        * Collection fullpath
  * Revoke (my ticket)
     * Authentication - iRODS credentials
     * Requires
        * GUID
     * Actions
        * Deletes ticket
     * Returns
        * success
  * List (all (my) existing tickets)
     * Authentication - iRODS credentials
     * Requires
        * Nothing
     * Actions
        * GenQuery for my tickets
     * Returns
        * List of GUIDs?

Questions...
 * Ticketbooth is authenticated?
 * iRODS credentials?
 * Does it need admin credentials?
 * Seems we need to know that joe is asking for a ticket for joe's collection.


If this is a subset/clone of https://github.com/irods/irods_client_rest_cpp ?
* It would not need more than host, zone, port in a config file
* Perfect to be dockerized
* Nginx reverse proxy... to four endpoints?
* Docker-compose can do it all?
* Deployment really could be just 'docker-compose up' with 3 environment variables... does that cover TLS/SSL to iRODS?  a certificate?
* Resolve endpoint apparently needs an admin account... so we're back to a config file with rodsadmin/password...


Use case, we want to encode the fullpath *in* the ticketvalue
* So GUI doesn't have to hit 'resolve', which would have required the ticketbooth to have admin account information
* Can we just use a JWT to hold the fullpath?  And then gateway-irods.go can decode the JWT with a shared secret and know where to navigate?



JWT BRAINSTORMING
* TicketBooth and MinIO will share a secret
   * Ticketbooth - can hold the secret in the config file
   * MinIO - secret can be an ENV or docker mount (from a config file)


Candidate REST endpoints...
* Create (new ticket)
   * Authentication - iRODS credentials
   * Requires
      * Collection fullpath
   * Actions
      * Generates a ticket (JWT, which encodes fullpath, via shared secret)
   * Returns
      * JWT
* Revoke (my ticket)
   * Authentication - iRODS credentials
   * Requires
      * JWT
   * Actions
      * Deletes ticket
   * Returns
      * Success
* List (all (my) existing tickets)
   * Authentication - iRODS credentials
   * Requires
      * Nothing
   * Actions
      * GenQuery for my tickets
   * Returns
      * List of JWTs?


If this is true...
* No rodsadmin required for ticketbooth app
   * Config file just has
      * Zone, port, host
      * Shared secret
      * SSL stuff?  Other irods environment things?
* MinIO just gets shared secret
   * IRODS_TICKETBOOTH_SHARED_SECRET ?
* Nothing special happens in iRODS Server, ... doesn't have to be the latest server, this is vanilla stuff.




Why do we need fullpath?
* Only for GUIs
* CLIs supply a fullpath directly
  * mc cp mylocalfile.txt s3://bucketname/prefix1/2/3/filename.txt


minIO GUI
* access/secret
* Draws a page, drops me somewhere...?  But where...
* With a ticket... it shouldn't drop me at the root... or my home collection, i don't have one (not a iRODS user)...
  * so it has to 'resolve' or 'decode' my fullpath... and drop me there, and draw a directory (collection) tree.


Made a repository…
* https://github.com/irods/irods_client_s3_ticketbooth 


Can it just be a Python Flask app?
* MVP is a single endpoint
   * /create
* Other two endpoints are nice-to-haves
   * /revoke
   * /list
* Easy to dockerize
   * Single config_file
   
Developed the s3 ticketbooth flask app...
* determined it looks extremely similar/identical to the tickets section of the C++ REST API
* C++ REST API just needs more flexibility/functionality for the ticket endpoint
   * more knobs for uses/bytes/expiry/etc.

So... added the functionality to the C++ REST API

Will probably abandon/archive the new repository for S3 Ticketbooth
