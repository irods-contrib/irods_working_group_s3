   - Work is progressing
   - Bucket mapping plugin prototype implemented
   - User mapping plugin prototype implemented
   - ListObjectsV2, GetObject, DeleteObject are passing tests
   - MultipartUpload is being implemented now
     - Possible to use redis to keep the persistence (b/c of HA)

   - Using boto as client for now to test

   - Could be multiuser through auth plugin/abstraction
   - Could be multibucket as well, we think
   - Will contact original author
 - JuiceFS frontend to iRODS
   - But does it do multiuser/multibucket?  We think no.
