## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - Native C++ S3 Implementation
   - Working endpoints: CopyObject, ListObjectsV2, GetObject, DeleteObject, HeadObject, PutObject
   - Two plugin interfaces defined:
     - Authentication - user mapping
     - Bucket Resolution - bucket mapping
   - Skipping implementation of multipartUpload for now
   - Focused on testing and packaging
 - S3 frontend to SFTPGo
   - Author doesn't currently have bandwidth for this project
 - Multipart Options
   - a) Multiobject - write all parts individually to irods, then complete triggers copy/concatenate/whatever
     - pro - relatively simple
     - con - lots of extra policy, could trigger replication to multiple continents (just a config option)
       - requires API plugin for concatenate()
   - b) Store-and-forward - write it all down in the bridge, then send it to irods
     - pro - simple, no extra policy
     - con - slow/delayed, need POTENTIALLY HUGE disk
   - c) Efficient store-and-forward - write down / hold non-contiguous parts in bridge - send contiguous parts to irods when ready
     - pro - elegant, single write
     - con - more complexity, need biggish disk
     - maybe off the table because a client can re-send the same numbered part and it should overwrite the earlier same part
       - OR... new thread!  offset, overwrite, who cares, same size, magic/perfect, just works, don't look at me…
   - d) Store-and-register - write it all down where irods can see it, then just register it in irods
     - pro - simple, fastest
     - con - just reg policy?, adds dependency on co-visibility of bridge and irods
       - cannot continue on failure (incomplete writes)
         - iRODS doesn't know what happened
         - Client has no way to recover
 - Illyoung - HDF5 file format?  Because we don't know the sizes ahead of time
   - Just write them down as they come, document the parts, and then register the whole thing in iRODS as hdf5 type… would require a server-translation thinger to give the file back to the user - same as option a) concatenate()
     - Possible polling/delay option - glacier-like until it's ready
   - Feels that (a) is probably the best path forward
     - Tim also agrees that this approach is closer to how S3 works
     - Core idea is similar to iput/ibun
     - Violet - plans on writing to a secret collection before concatenating all parts
     - Kory - What happens if policy exists and it modifies permissions on the parts?
   - Is multipart upload required?
   - No. Minio doesn't implement it
 - Possible 'option' flag to pick a/b/c/d mode… we could implement more than one of these
 - Nirav - people will use well known tooling to communicate with this
   - We can try to support a wide range of tools, but we may hit a wall
   - OR, we can list a set of tools which are supported
   - Common tools appear to be the AWS client and Boto3
 - Nirav - What versions of iRODS does this target?
   - Kory - We're targeting versions of iRODS that support the necessary features
     - Meaning 4.2.11+ possibly
   - We need people who are able to test it out
 - Next Meeting
   - Mar 2023
