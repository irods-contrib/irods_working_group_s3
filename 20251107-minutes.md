## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - iRODS S3 API - Separate keypair and bucket management
   - Completed - released as part of v0.5.0
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_s3_api/releases/tag/0.5.0 
   - Keypair and bucket definition files are validated against a schema
   - Reloaded when stat() detects a change
 - S3 plugin - Attach a bucket to a logical path
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_resource_plugin_s3/issues/2196 
   - No updates
 - S3 plugin - working to add CRC checksums
   - To reduce/eliminate need to download entire object to calculate
   - Investigating performance improvement for checksum validation
     - Added CRC64/NVME as a valid checksum scheme in main server
     - Adding CRC64/NVME trailing checksum on upload in S3 plugin
       - Validated by the vendor/appliance
       - But iRODS *is* the client to the appliance
       - We would need to confirm with the iRODS client the same
     - Working to retrieve checksum recorded by S3 rather than reading the entire object
   - AWS S3 does calculate/store CRC64/NVME by default (since 1y or so ago)
   - MinIO does NOT calculate/store it by default, but it can be asked to store
 - iRODS MCP Server from CyVerse / Arizona
   - Open source newly posted, just the iRODS communication part
   - https://github.com/cyverse/irods-mcp-server 
 - Next Meeting
   - February 2026
