## TESTING

- 4.3.1 iRODS Server
- S3 API 0.1.0 - no multipart, was not using switchuser, or connection pool

- Testing harness not public (yet)

### iRODS S3 Transfer Performance

Here are the results of comparing the S3 API file transfers using the AWS CLI to file transfers made by GoCommands and iCommands. Transfers of 1 kiB files are used to compared the overhead of the client, i.e., the amount of time the client takes outside of transferring data. Transfers of 1 GiB files are used to compare client throughput. Both uploads and downloads are compared. Each transfer is performed five times. The geometric mean is reported in seconds along with the its 1 geometric standard deviation bounds.


#### 1 kiB Transfer

```
Tool                      | Download Duration (s) | Upload Duration (s)
--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------
iRODS S3 API over AWS CLI | 1.27 [1.22, 1.33]     | 0.85 [0.76, 0.95]
GoCommands                | 0.40 [0.40, 0.40]     | 0.53 [0.39, 0.73]
iCommands                 | 0.25 [0.20, 0.32]     | 0.31 [0.26, 0.38]
```
