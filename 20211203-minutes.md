## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - Updates
   - Minio gateway linkâ€¦ https://github.com/cyverse/minio-irods-gateway
   - Learned that we cannot get into upstream
   - Gateway is working, cloned from HDFS gateway
     - HDFS currently ignores files in root directory
     - Not quite what we want
     - Mapping the top level to buckets (or not)...
   - Options
     - A) Continue ignoring top level
     - B) Uni-bucket projection, top level of access IS the bucket
       - May be the winner due to ticket access already associated with a single iRODS collection
       - This would mean a minio login would 'land' at the root, and be presented with a single bucket to click on...
         - whose name would be the 'bottom/last' collection name of the iRODS full logical path being accessed.
       - *if* a ticket could provide access to multiple collections
         - they could *all* be listed here...
         - but tickets don't do that at the moment... they're 1-to-1
   - Ticket access is recursive
     - https://docs.irods.org/4.2.10/system_overview/users_and_permissions/#tickets-guest-access
     - Once you're 'in', you can navigate around 'underneath' that top level location
   - Minio itself can 'share' a stable URL for a listed file
     - Should be relatively stable over time for re-login
     - Still subject to iRODS enforcement on the backend
   - Next steps
     - Using real iRODS tickets to login
       - currently only using hard-coded username/password
 - Next Meeting
