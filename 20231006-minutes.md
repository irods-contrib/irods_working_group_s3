## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - Native C++ S3 Implementation
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_s3_cpp/pull/18
   - HeadObject, ListBuckets, ListObjectsV2, range header implemented
   - Configurable buffer sizes
   - Working on packaging / testing suite automation
   - Testing suite for:
     - minio (mc) - coming
     - aws - working
     - boto - working
   - Needs 'no multipart upload' README notes
     - Workaround is to set part size up to 5GB
     - Multipart upload idea is on a napkin
     - Downloads are probably more interesting to initial users
   - Hopefully a copy/paste to get 4.2-compatibility from HTTP API to here
     - C++ coroutines are a little different here
   - No load balancing planned yet
     - Might need to learn and incorporate later
     - e.g. varnish cache, HAProxy, nginx
