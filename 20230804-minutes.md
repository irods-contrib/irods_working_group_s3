## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - Native C++ S3 Implementation
   - Better packaged, still depends on unreleased iRODS 4.3.1
     - Newer boost 1.81 (boost::url)
     - New API - rc_switch_user()
       - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_s3_cpp/pull/12
       - DEMO FRIDAY!
   - Tested with a few clients
     - Boto-based python application - working, so far
     - Minio-based python application - wrong endpoint / generating stacktrace
     - Minio-client (mc) - some success, some failures
     - AWS cli - not working, HMAC signature mismatch
   - Need more eyeballs / S3 handshake knowledge welcome
     - Different authentication algorithms
   - Can we just switch on server version?
     - Use rc_switch_user()
     - Regular, slower implementation
     - Could talk to iRODS 4.2.x
 - Next Meeting
   - Sept 2023

 - After meeting
   - Using mc --debug, was able to send some additional headers
   - ./mc ls and ./mc cp worked!
