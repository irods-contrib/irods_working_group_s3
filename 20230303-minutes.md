DISCUSSION

 - Native C++ S3 Implementation
   - Punted on multipart for initial release/testing
   - Addressing surprising packaging opportunities
   - Next steps
     - stand up with minio client
     - Point iRODS to this as a storage resource, pass our own test suite
     - Performance get/put numbers - knowing that there's no multipart
   - Currently will require 4.3.1 (b/c of the new switch_user functionality)
     - https://github.com/irods/irods/commit/f24e6f95c42be48e9137e109727731c666a8362c
     - Could/will pull out new 4.3.1 API endpoint into a plugin for 4.2.x if helpful/necessary
 - rclone and webdav - most interesting/used way for CyVerse users to get information in/out of the system
   - Concerns about overwhelming excitement about a good S3 endpoint
     - How do we prevent being run over by big usage (accidental or malicious)
     - Connection limiting
   - Strong README information about how to hold it well / safely
     - CyVerse PR with earned knowledge
   - Reverse proxy could help here
     - It's 'just' http/https
   - Would be nice to support the proxy protocol
