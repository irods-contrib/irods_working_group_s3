## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - iRODS S3 API
   - UGM2024 talk on 'store-and-forward'
     - Has to wait for two read/write cycles AND the first to finish before starting the second
       - Not as fast as we want, but the bytes do appear correctly
   - Have started on 'efficient store-and-forward'
     - Leaning into the assumption that most parts will come to us 'in order'
     - Will send contiguous parts to iRODS as they are received/ready
     - Coordination of replica access tokens in shared memory
     - Chunked encoding may prove a little tricky - TBD
 - Zarr resource plugin
   - Should we clone the S3 resource plugin instead of unixfilesystem?
   - https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/v3.0.html
   - Similar to HDF5 / hierarchical - but in a fileset, rather than a single file
   - Possibly with OMERO to store/read image data efficiently
 - Illyoung - issue
   - Large file transfer - redirect to resource 16threads, too much
     - Crashed in kubernetes, constrained, timedout, no ack
     - Changed to 4, now completing!
 - Tony wants to attach a bucket to a logical_path
   - Made an issue!
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_resource_plugin_s3/issues/2196 
   - Early implementation is linked, new archive_naming_policy
   - Alternate possibility is to treat this as a logical_path restriction only
     - But this doesn't take into consideration the physical path in the bucket
 - Next Meeting
   - July 2024
