## Minutes

DISCUSSION

 - Native C++ S3 Implementation
   - Released v0.1.0 on Nov 10
   - Working on demo for next week's TRiRODS
   - Tony
     - Successfully stood up, instructions good - connected
     - But not thorough testing yet, coming soon
 - iRODS S3 resource plugin is absorbing the libs3 code
   - Reduce our dependencies on a separate repository
   - Due to no upstream work on libs3 since 2016/2018
   - iRODS fork was 15 commits ahead
   - Means the iRODS S3 resource plugin is changing license
     - From BSD-3 to GPLv2
     - Does not infect the iRODS server b/c compiled shared object
 - AWS SDK is C++ and high level
   - We have looked at using it directly, but it was not sufficient for our needs
   - Could merit looking again, it's been a while
   - But a shift in our usage would move a lot of code
   - Little upside at this moment, we think
 - Markus CMake and gcc/libstdc++ work
   - We are planning to refactor/remove the coroutines from S3 API
   - Backing off from coroutines for now
     - it would require us to use a more current compiler everywhere
     - that's a lot of work
 - Next Meeting
